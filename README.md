## What are we hypothesizing?

We hypothesize that the meanings of words and images exist in a shared conceptual space.

Here, we model $S$, the corresponding reaction time associated with semantic processing, as the sum of perceptual, conceptual, and task-specific processes (and some error). 

$$
S = \mathbf{p} + \mathbf{x} + \mathbf{t} + \epsilon
$$
